# User Guide — Spine

> **Spine** is the product; it's distributed as the **`synaptixs-spine`** package
> and its command is **`orchestrator`**. Install lines and commands below use those
> names verbatim.

Point it at a **code repo** and a **requirements source** (a Confluence page, a
Notion page, or a Markdown file). It turns requirements into working, tested code
and opens a **reviewed pull request** — pausing for **your approval** at two
points: before it starts building, and before anything merges.

You stay in control the whole way. Nothing is pushed, merged, or written to your
tracker unless you say so.

This guide is a straight line. Do **Step 0 → Step 4** and you'll have your first
change in hand. Everything after that is optional, in roughly the order you'll
want it.

| Steps | You get |
|---|---|
| **0–4** | Installed, configured, and your first feature built locally — then a real PR. |
| **5–6** | Preview before you run; run fully offline on a local model. |
| **7–8** | The hands-off pipeline with a web dashboard, and smarter (agentic) codegen. |
| **9–10** | Connect external tools (MCP), and call Spine from Claude/Codex. |
| **11** | Troubleshooting. |

---

## Step 0 — What you'll need

The essentials (Steps 1–4):

- **Python 3.12+** and **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)**
  — `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- **An LLM** — either an API key (`OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
  **or** [Ollama](#step-6--run-fully-offline-on-a-local-model-no-api-key) for a
  local model with no key (Step 6).

Add these when you want real source/PR work (Step 4 onward):

- **Confluence / Jira** credentials — to read requirements and (optionally) file issues.
- A **GitHub repo** — the repo it builds *into* — plus a token or GitHub App for private repos.

Only for the full pipeline + dashboard (Step 7):

- **Docker** — runs Temporal + Postgres locally.

You do **not** need Docker, a database, or any servers for Steps 1–6.

---

## Step 1 — Install

The published package is `synaptixs-spine`; the command it gives you is
`orchestrator`.

### From PyPI (just the tool)

```bash
pip install synaptixs-spine
orchestrator --help
```

Optional extras, added when you need them:
- `pip install 'synaptixs-spine[sdlc]'` — run the generated tests (the `sdlc feature`/`run` path)
- `pip install 'synaptixs-spine[tui]'` — the `orchestrator tui` terminal UI (Step 7)
- `[java]`, `[typescript]`, `[csharp]`, `[c]`, `[cpp]`, `[go]`, `[sql]` — language parsers for
  comprehension + grounding (Python needs no extra). C# codegen also needs the **.NET SDK**
  (`dotnet`) on PATH; C / C++ codegen needs a C / C++ compiler plus **CMake** (greenfield) or
  **Meson + Ninja** (matching the target repo's build system); **Go** codegen needs the **`go`
  toolchain** on PATH (`go build`/`go test`). `[sql]` adds `.sql`
  comprehension (schema/queries/procedures + migration folding) — no toolchain needed.
- `[docs]` — **PDF** doc ingestion (`.md`/`.rst`/`.txt` need no extra). With it, `understand`/`state`
  fold your PDFs into the graph too; without it, PDFs are simply skipped.
- `[mcp]` (MCP client), `[otel]` (live tracing)

### Upgrading

- **PyPI install:** `pip install --upgrade synaptixs-spine` (verify with `pip show synaptixs-spine`).
- **Source checkout:** `git pull && uv sync --extra dev`.

### From source (needed for Step 7's pipeline, or to develop)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/synaptixs/spine
cd spine
uv sync --extra dev            # installs the project + dev tools
uv run orchestrator --help     # in this layout, prefix CLI calls with `uv run`
```

> The rest of the guide writes plain `orchestrator …`. On a source checkout,
> read that as `uv run orchestrator …`.

---

## Step 2 — Configure

```bash
orchestrator init      # scaffolds a commented .env, then checks readiness
# open .env and fill in: your LLM key, your model, and (later) Confluence/Jira + repo
orchestrator doctor    # readiness report — tells you exactly what's set and what's missing
```

`doctor` reads `.env` automatically — run it from the folder that has your
`.env`. Start minimal; you only need the LLM settings for your first run.

| Setting | What it's for | Needed by |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Your LLM provider | Step 3 |
| `ORCHESTRATOR_INTAKE_MODEL` | One model for everything, e.g. `gpt-4o` | Step 3 |
| `CONFLUENCE_*`, `JIRA_*` | Read requirements / file issues | Step 4 |
| `SDLC_REPO_URL` | The repo it builds **into** | Step 4 |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` *(or `GITHUB_APP_*`)* | Auth for a private target repo | Step 4 |

> **Tip:** set `ORCHESTRATOR_INTAKE_MODEL` explicitly (e.g. `gpt-4o`). One model
> then drives every stage. A heavyweight default can time out on large code
> generations.

---

## Step 2.5 — Understand the project (optional, recommended)

Build a committed, code-true knowledge base before generating anything:

```bash
orchestrator understand .        # writes ./episteme/*.md
```

It extracts the Product Knowledge Graph + project profile and renders
`architecture.md`, `domain-model.md`, `tech-context.md`, `conventions.md`, and
`glossary.md` — deterministic, no LLM. Brownfield repos get a real map of what's
there; greenfield repos get a stub that fills in as features land. Re-run anytime
to refresh (`--refresh` re-extracts instead of using the commit cache). Commit
`episteme/` so your team — and any AI tool — reads the same project truth.

Your repo's **documentation** is folded in at the same time: Markdown, reST, and plain-text
docs (and **PDF**, with the `[docs]` extra) become `Doc` nodes linked to the code they
describe. Nothing to turn on — a repo with no docs just skips it. This powers the
**Documentation** section in `state` (below) and the `docs_for` `/spine` tool.

For a **team-facing snapshot of what the repo is today and how healthy it looks**, use
the Current State report (also no LLM — synthesized from the same graph):

```bash
orchestrator state .                       # developer view, to stdout
orchestrator state . --lens stakeholder    # plain-language view
orchestrator state . --out STATE.md        # write it to a file
```

It renders a plain-language **overview**, an **infrastructure & runtime** breakdown (the
datastores, queues, cloud, container services and external APIs the repo declares it needs —
from its manifests, build files, and `docker-compose`), a **code-structure** map (layout by
component + entry points), a **system-architecture diagram** (components grouped into zones,
with weighted dependency arrows from the import/`#include` graph), a **component-dependency**
table, **call-graph hotspots**, complexity/god-components, test-coverage and recent-activity
signals, a **Documentation** section (symbol coverage % + top doc drift, from the ingested
docs), a name-based security surface, and prioritized recommendations. A report is a
*view* — re-run to refresh; nothing is written unless `--out` is given.

To turn one feature idea into a **grounded design before writing code**, use `design`:

```bash
orchestrator design . --title "Add CSV export" -c "downloads a .csv"   # heuristic, to stdout
orchestrator design . --title "Add CSV export" --llm --out DESIGN.md   # LLM writes the prose
```

It anchors the design to the repo's real modules and adds a **Blast radius** section from the
knowledge graph — for each module the design touches, who imports it and which of its symbols
have the most callers (the risky-to-change hotspots) — plus a **Unverified references** flag
for any named path that doesn't exist in the graph (a hallucinated file, or a genuinely new
one to confirm). Deterministic by default; `--llm` (needs a provider) writes the approach and
interfaces. Symbol-level hotspots need a call graph, so on languages without one the report
says so and gives module-level impact only.

To **research a ticket against the codebase before designing**, use `investigate` — it takes a
ticket (from a source or inline) and produces a brief: where it lands in the code (real
symbols with `file:line` + caller counts), the relevant committed `episteme/` knowledge, and,
when the pipeline's registry DB is configured, prior-run notes. Deterministic, no LLM.

```bash
orchestrator investigate . --source jira://PROJ-123     # research a real ticket
orchestrator investigate . --title "Login 500s on empty token"   # or an inline problem
```

When you have a **stack trace or a failing test**, `localize` resolves each frame to the repo
symbol it names (`file:line`), points at the likely fault site, and lists who calls it — the
first step of a root-cause investigation. Deterministic, no LLM. Feed it a trace via `--trace`,
`--text`, or stdin:

```bash
pytest 2>&1 | orchestrator localize .            # pipe a failing run straight in
orchestrator localize . --trace crash.log        # or from a saved traceback
```

For the **full root-cause analysis**, `rca` goes a step further: it localizes the bug, then
reports the fault site, ranked root-cause **hypotheses** with evidence (callers, recent git
churn, the exception), the **regression surface** a fix must cover, and a scoped fix approach.
It **stops at the report — no code is changed** (a human decides). Deterministic by default;
`--llm` enriches the hypotheses. The bug can be a trace, a `jira://` Bug, or inline text:

```bash
pytest 2>&1 | orchestrator rca .                 # a failing test → grounded RCA
orchestrator rca . --source jira://PROJ-42        # a Jira Bug → grounded RCA
orchestrator rca . --trace crash.log --llm --out rca.md
```

Before you change a symbol, `regression` tells you **what to re-test**: it walks the call
graph to find everything that depends on the target, then splits the blast radius into tests
that already exercise it and production code with **no covering test** — the regression gaps.
Deterministic, no LLM. Give it a symbol or a fault site:

```bash
orchestrator regression . --symbol validate_token   # what breaks if I change this?
orchestrator regression . --trace crash.log          # or use the fault site from a trace
```

> **Call graphs.** `localize`, `rca`, and `regression` (and the design **Blast radius**) trace
> caller/callee edges — now extracted for **Python, C, C++, C#, Java, TypeScript, and Go** (Java/TS
> call graphs were added alongside these commands). On a language without one, the reports say
> so and fall back to module-level impact rather than implying zero.

> **Local path _or_ git URL.** `understand`, `state`, `profile`, `catalog plan`, and
> `pkg extract`/`export`/`docs` accept either — `orchestrator state https://github.com/org/repo`
> shallow-clones it to a temp dir, analyses it, and cleans up (for `understand` on a URL the
> episteme lands in `./episteme`, since the clone is transient). Public providers
> (github.com / bitbucket.org / gitlab.com) work out of the box; add an enterprise host with
> `ORCHESTRATOR_REPO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=git.acme.com`. `file://`, plaintext `http://`, and
> private/loopback hosts are always refused (SSRF guard). The web UI exposes the same on every
> Understand page — a **Browse…** button to pick a local folder, or paste a URL.

**Where it's stored.** `episteme/` is the one artifact you **commit** — the durable,
versioned, code-true doc your team and any AI tool reads. The graph it renders from is a
regenerable cache at `~/.cache/orchestrator/pkg/` (rebuilt from code on every commit, so it
can't go stale); the Current State report is a *view* you regenerate on demand. So the habit
is: `orchestrator understand .` → commit `episteme/`, then re-run whenever the code moves.

> **Deep dive:** see **[KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md](KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md)** for the full PKG
> guide — the data model, the CLI (`pkg extract` / `export` / `docs`), **where each
> artifact is persisted**, how grounding uses it, and how it works for brownfield and
> greenfield projects.

> **Multi-language.** Comprehension covers **Python** out of the box and **Java**,
> **TypeScript**, **C#**, **C**, **C++**, **Go**, and **SQL** when the matching parser extra is
> installed (`pip install 'synaptixs-spine[java]'` / `[typescript]` / `[csharp]` / `[c]` /
> `[cpp]` / `[go]` / `[sql]`). `understand`, codegen grounding, and `pkg extract` then process
> `.java` / `.ts` / `.cs` / `.c` / `.h` / `.cpp` / `.hpp` / `.go` / `.sql` too. For **SQL**, the
> graph models the **data layer from source** — `CREATE TABLE`/columns → `Entity`/`Field`,
> foreign keys → `REFERENCES`, views and `SELECT`/`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` → `READS`/
> `WRITES`, and stored procedures → `Function` + `CALLS`. A `migrations/` folder is folded
> in order (so you see the *current* schema, with `DROP`/`RENAME` applied), and a `.sql`
> schema is treated as authoritative over ORM-inferred foreign keys. The **dialect is
> auto-detected per file** (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server/Oracle/…) so each parses under its own
> grammar; pin it with `--dialect` on `pkg extract`/`understand`/`state`. **Greenfield SQL
> codegen** works too: `sdlc feature --language sql` scaffolds a `migrations/` directory,
> generates a DDL migration for the intent, and validates it by **applying it to an ephemeral
> database** (in-memory SQLite by default — zero toolchain; set `SDLC_SQL_ENGINE=postgres`
> with the `[sql-postgres]` extra + Docker for real-Postgres fidelity). A failed apply is the
> refine signal, exactly like a failing test. For **C#**, the graph additionally captures
> ASP.NET Core endpoints (`EXPOSES`) and EF Core entities (`REFERENCES`); codegen scaffolds a
> solution + xUnit project and runs `dotnet test` (needs the **.NET SDK**). For **C**,
> it builds the `#include` graph and merges header declarations with their source
> definitions; codegen scaffolds a **CMake** project (greenfield) or works in a brownfield
> **Meson** repo, building + testing via `ctest` / `meson test` (needs a C compiler plus
> CMake or Meson+Ninja). **C++** is a superset of the C front-end — it reuses the include
> graph and header/source merge and adds classes, namespaces, inheritance (`IMPLEMENTS`),
> member functions, and templates; codegen scaffolds a CMake **CXX** project and builds +
> tests via `ctest` (needs a C++ compiler plus CMake). For **Go**, the module unit is the
> **package (its directory)**, so every `.go` file in a dir merges into one component; the
> graph carries the call graph (`CALLS`), same-package struct-field `REFERENCES`, and — the
> Go highlight — **interface satisfaction** (`IMPLEMENTS`), computed by matching a concrete
> type's method set (name + arity, value **and** pointer receivers) against each in-repo
> interface. Codegen writes idiomatic Go into the target package and builds + tests it with
> `go build ./...` / `go test ./...` (needs the **`go` toolchain**); it is **multi-module
> aware** — the runner builds and tests the module(s) the change actually touches, not just
> the repo root, so code generated into a sub-module is never a false green.

### Working with existing repos (brownfield) — and how knowledge grows

Spine understands a repo from its **own code**: it builds a Product Knowledge Graph
(PKG) and a committed `episteme/`, then grounds every action in that. ontomesh
(domain ontology) is an *optional* add-on — not the thing that reads your code.

**Brownfield — comprehend, then deliver:**

1. **Comprehend** the existing codebase (deterministic, no LLM):
   ```bash
   orchestrator understand .       # PKG → episteme/*.md
   orchestrator profile .          # quick architecture profile
   orchestrator audit .            # surface findings / issues
   ```
2. **Deliver** new intents or bug fixes, grounded in the repo's real layout and
   conventions — `--layout auto` follows the existing structure and never scaffolds:
   ```bash
   orchestrator sdlc feature --source file://./spec.md --safe
   ```
   The `[grounding] target-KG context: N chars` line is it reusing what's already there.
3. **Findings** come from the same PKG: blast-radius scoping, the reviewer pass, `audit`.

**Greenfield — knowledge grows as you build.** The first `understand` writes a stub and
the first `feature` run scaffolds `src/<package>/` + `tests/`. From there the PKG and
`episteme/` fill in with every feature that lands — re-run
`orchestrator understand . --refresh` so the committed knowledge keeps pace. The repo
accumulates its own code-true memory as it grows.

> **Optional domain layer.** For domain-heavy systems (fraud, telecom, healthcare) you
> can compose *business-domain* knowledge on top of the code-true grounding (Spine
> Seam 1, `SPINE_ONTOMESH_URL`) — see [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md#the-semantic-spine).
> It augments comprehension; it never replaces the PKG.

---

## Step 3 — Your first build (local and safe)

This is the core loop, with zero infrastructure. It reads one requirement, writes
code grounded in the target repo's own structure, generates tests, and leaves you
a **local branch + diff** to inspect. No pushes, no PRs, nothing external.

```bash
orchestrator sdlc feature --source confluence://<page_id> --safe
```

- `--source` also accepts `notion://<page_id>`, `file://./spec.md`,
  **`jira://<root>`** (read existing tickets — `jira://PROJ-123` walks an issue and its
  subtasks/epic children, `jira://PROJ` a whole project, `jira://jql/<query>` a saved
  search; uses the same `JIRA_*` creds as issue creation), or
  **`openspec://<change-id>`** (spec-driven: reads an [OpenSpec](https://openspec.dev)
  change under `openspec/changes/` and maps its `### Requirement:`/`#### Scenario:`
  blocks straight to acceptance criteria — **deterministic, no LLM extraction**, so
  intents are exactly what the spec states; `openspec://` alone runs every change).
  To go the other way — **bootstrap** an OpenSpec change *from* a wiki page for a human
  to polish — run `orchestrator openspec draft --source confluence://<id> --out ./openspec`,
  edit the generated `openspec/changes/<id>/`, then `sdlc feature --source openspec://<id>`.
- `--safe` is the safe default: dry-run tracker, local commit, **no push**.
- Pin one requirement with `--intent <intent-id>` if a page has several.

> **Stable, tracked backlog.** The extracted intents are cached deterministically
> (first run extracts; later runs reuse — no re-fetch, no LLM — until `--refresh`),
> so a pinned `--intent` is stable. Each run also writes a **`BACKLOG.md`** ledger:
> `[ ]` todo, `[~]` in progress (a `--live` PR is open), `[x]` done (PR merged, via
> `sdlc complete`). View/regenerate it anytime with
> `orchestrator backlog --source confluence://<page_id>`.

> **Isolated test env.** The pipeline runs the generated tests in a **per-project
> venv** it creates in the worktree, installing pytest + the project's deps (and any
> missing import) automatically — so you don't pre-install test deps. Optional knobs:
> `SDLC_TEST_ISOLATION=local` uses the orchestrator's own interpreter instead;
> `ORCHESTRATOR_LLM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 120) widens the LLM timeout for large pages.

**Code structure (`--layout`).** The runner places generated code by target:
- **Greenfield repo** → it **scaffolds** a `src/<package>/` skeleton (package name
  derived from the repo, e.g. `Example-Service.` → `example_service`),
  with `tests/` and a pytest-ready `pyproject`, then generates into it. The first
  `--live` run lands this structure on the remote as part of the PR; later runs detect
  it and extend it.
- **Existing codebase** → it **follows the repo's layout**, never scaffolding.
- Default is `--layout auto` (the above). Force it with `--layout new|existing`, and
  override the name with `--package-name <name>`.

As it runs it prints each stage, including `[layout] mode=… package=…` and
`[grounding] target-KG context: N chars` — that's it reading the existing codebase so
the new code reuses what's already there. When it finishes, check out the branch it
made and read the diff.

---

## Step 4 — Go live: a real issue + pull request

When the local result looks right, let it do the real thing — file a Jira issue,
push a branch, and open a PR:

```bash
orchestrator sdlc feature --source confluence://<page_id> --live
```

A human reviews and merges the PR (it never merges on its own). After the merge,
close the loop so the tracker issue moves to Done:

```bash
orchestrator sdlc complete --pr https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/<n>
```

That's the whole everyday workflow: **`feature --safe` → look → `feature --live`
→ merge → `complete`.**

---

## Step 5 — Preview before you run (read-only)

Want to see what it *would* do without spending an LLM call or touching anything?

```bash
orchestrator ingest --source confluence://<page_id>     # the backlog it reads (dry-run)
orchestrator ingest --source confluence://<page_id> --create   # actually file the issues

orchestrator profile .                                   # languages, framework, DB, tests, task type
orchestrator catalog plan . --intent "Add CSV export"    # the capabilities it would assemble (Step 8)
```

All read-only except `ingest --create`. (The same backlog preview is also a
point-and-click page in the web UI — **Backlog**, `/app/backlog` — see Step 7.)

---

## Step 6 — Run fully offline on a local model (no API key)

No key, fully private: point it at [Ollama](https://ollama.com) (local or a
hosted endpoint). `doctor` accepts Ollama as a valid provider.

```bash
# Local: `ollama pull qwen2.5-coder` then `ollama serve`, then in .env:
OLLAMA_API_BASE=http://localhost:11434
ORCHESTRATOR_INTAKE_MODEL=ollama/qwen2.5-coder

# Hosted Ollama / any OpenAI-compatible endpoint:
OLLAMA_API_BASE=https://your-ollama-host
```

**Model choice matters more than the provider.** Reading requirements and review
run fine on modest models, but code generation emits strict JSON and anchored
edits — use a **coder** model there. You can even mix local and cloud per stage:

```bash
ORCHESTRATOR_INTAKE_MODEL=ollama/qwen2.5-coder   # cheap stages, local
SDLC_CODEGEN_MODEL=gpt-4o                         # codegen, cloud quality
SDLC_REVIEW_MODEL=ollama/qwen2.5-coder            # the review judge
```

---

## Step 7 — The full pipeline + web dashboard

Steps 3–6 build one requirement at a time from the terminal. When you want
**hands-off runs across many requirements**, the **web UI** (a delegation inbox,
console, and trace), and durable execution that survives restarts, switch on the
pipeline. This is the part that
needs Docker, and it runs from a **source checkout** (Step 1, option 2).

**7.1 — The one-command way (recommended):**
```bash
orchestrator up
```
That single command brings up the Docker infra (Postgres + Temporal), applies
migrations, and launches **both** the web/API server and the SDLC worker with
sensible defaults. When it prints **“Spine is up”**, open `http://localhost:8000/app`
and log in with the API key it shows (`dev-key` by default). **Ctrl-C** stops the app
processes (the infra containers stay up for fast restarts). It needs Docker running
and an LLM key in your `.env` (for real codegen). Flags: `--port`, `--no-worker`
(browse-only), `--no-docker` (infra already running), `--compose-file`.

Prefer to run the pieces yourself (or need to customise ports/env)? The manual path
below is exactly what `orchestrator up` automates.

**7.1a — Start the stack and create the database (once):**
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d     # Temporal + Postgres + MinIO
set -a; source .env; set +a                        # load .env into this shell
export SDLC_CODEGEN=llm ORCHESTRATOR_API_KEY=dev-key
# The web UI signs cookies with this secret — set any random value:
export ORCHESTRATOR_SESSION_SECRET=$(python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))")
uv run alembic upgrade head                        # create the schema
```

**7.2 — Start the two processes (separate terminals):**
```bash
# Terminal 1 — the worker that executes the pipeline stages:
uv run python -m orchestrator.sdlc.worker

# Terminal 2 — the REST API + the whole web UI (one process serves every page):
uv run uvicorn orchestrator.registry.api.app:app --factory --port 8000
```

> The worker reads the **process environment**, not `.env` — always
> `set -a; source .env; set +a` in its terminal first.

**7.3 — Sign in, then launch a run.** Open `http://localhost:8000/app` — you're sent
to `/login`; sign in once with your `ORCHESTRATOR_API_KEY` (the session cookie then
authenticates every page). Start a run from the **Inbox** (paste a source, click
**Delegate**), or from the terminal:
```bash
orchestrator sdlc run --source confluence://<page_id> --max-features 1
# prints the sdlc_id and the gate ids: sdlc-<id>-0 (intents), sdlc-<id>-1 (merge),
# plus sdlc-<id>-2 (designs) when the design gate is enabled — see 7.3a
```

Approve a gate by clicking **Approve / Reject** in the Inbox or Console — or via the API:
```bash
curl -X POST -H "x-api-key: dev-key" http://localhost:8000/v1/approvals/sdlc-<id>-0/approve
```

**7.3a — What a run does before it writes code.** The pipeline **comprehends the repo**
first — it builds the same knowledge graph + `episteme/` as `understand`, and folds a
one-line summary into the intents gate, so you approve the extracted intents *and* see that
Spine read the codebase. After you approve intents and it creates issues, a **design wave**
produces a grounded, per-issue **design** (approach, files-to-touch, interfaces, risks, test
strategy — anchored to the repo's real modules) that each feature then builds to. Both the
comprehension and the designs are saved as **run artifacts**: expand the run in the **Console**
to download `knowledge-graph.db`, the episteme docs, and each issue's
`design.md` / `design.json`.

Three pipeline flags control this (comprehension + design are **on** by default; the extra
design *gate* is **off** so runs don't gain a mandatory pause unless you want one):

| Env var | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `SDLC_COMPREHEND` | on | Comprehend the repo before the intents gate. |
| `SDLC_DESIGN` | on | Produce a grounded design per issue before codegen. |
| `SDLC_DESIGN_GATE` | **off** | Add a human **“approve designs”** gate (Gate 1.5, id `sdlc-<id>-2`) after the design wave, before any code is written. |

**7.4 — The web UI (sign in at `/login` first):** one app, one nav, one login. The
left sidebar groups every surface into sections:

**Deliver** — hand work over and watch it ship.
| URL | What you see |
|---|---|
| `/app/inbox` | **Inbox** — delegate a run, watch it progress **live** (server-sent events), approve/reject gates **inline**. The front door. |
| `/app/intake` | **Intake studio** — preview any source (Confluence / Notion / file / OpenSpec) as a backlog, then delegate a gated run (dry-run by default). |
| `/app/backlog` | **Backlog preview** — a source rendered as a derived backlog (read-only). |
| `/console` | **Console** — the approval queue + runs dashboard (state filter, inline trace, export a run's timeline). Expand a run to download its **comprehension + design artifacts** (knowledge graph, episteme, per-issue designs). |

**Understand** — repo intelligence. Point at a **local path _or_ a git URL** (GitHub / Bitbucket / GitLab / enterprise) — **Browse…** picks a local folder, or paste a URL (cloned on demand).
| URL | What you see |
|---|---|
| `/app/understand` | Build the code-true **episteme** for a repo (runs as a job, with live progress). |
| `/app/state` | **Current State** report (developer / stakeholder lens), rendered in-app. |
| `/app/memory-bank` | Browse a repo's committed `episteme/*.md`. |
| `/app/graph` | **Knowledge graph** — a module-level overview (node/edge mix, biggest modules, dependencies, top symbols). |
| `/app/catalog` | What Spine can do in this repo — the capability catalog + a per-intent plan. |

**Govern** — the "governed autonomy" story, made visible.
| URL | What you see |
|---|---|
| `/app/audit` | **Audit log** — the append-only record of every action; filter by run / actor / action. |
| `/app/governance` | **Policy & budget** — per-run spend vs the cap, policy + approval decisions, and a one-click run-bundle **export**. |

**Quality**
| URL | What you see |
|---|---|
| `/app/evals` | **Evals** — skill quality + how the eval harness works. |
| `/app/memory` | **Cross-run memory** — the conventions / pitfalls the engineer learned across runs. |
| `/app/advanced` | **Advanced** — which gated subsystems (agentic loop, semantic spine) are wired. |

**Connect · Registry · System**
| URL | What you see |
|---|---|
| `/app/connections` | **Connections** — MCP servers (list, live-test, **browse to pick an `mcp.json`**, and — when enabled — add/edit/remove) + source/tracker status. |
| `/app/registry` | **Registry** — agent templates, tool contracts, glossary. |
| `/app/personas` | **Personas & skills** — the personas the engineer adopts and the skills they apply. |
| `/app/system` | **System** — readiness (the `doctor` env checks) + a live database probe. |
| `/trace/<sdlc_id>` | **Run timeline** — the ordered stages for one run (intake → codegen → tests → review → merge). |
| `http://localhost:8233` | **Temporal UI** — the raw execution: every activity, retries, per-stage pass/fail (where the actual test output lives). |

**7.5 — Access & safety config (safe by default).** Two surfaces reach beyond the
current repo — analysing a repo by URL, and editing MCP config — so both are gated
by environment variables you opt into:

| Env var | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `ORCHESTRATOR_WORKSPACE_ROOT` | the cwd `up` ran in | Local repo paths must resolve under this root. |
| `ORCHESTRATOR_REPO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | `github.com,bitbucket.org,gitlab.com` | Hosts a repo URL may be cloned from. Add an enterprise/custom host, or `*` for any. `file://` / `http://` / localhost / private IPs are always blocked. |
| `ORCHESTRATOR_REPO_ALLOW_ANY_LOCAL` | off | Allow any absolute **local** repo path (trusted single-user). |
| `ORCHESTRATOR_MCP_CONFIG_WRITABLE` | off | Allow adding/editing MCP servers from the Connections page (writes `mcp.json`; a stdio server's `command` is executed on this machine — off by default). |

> Non-GitHub private repos authenticate via your **ambient git credentials**
> (SSH agent / credential helper / a token in the URL); GitHub uses `GITHUB_TOKEN`
> or a GitHub App. Public repos need nothing.

> Prefer the terminal? `pip install 'synaptixs-spine[tui]'` then `orchestrator tui`
> — the same watch-runs / clear-gates / delegate actions, keyboard-driven, over the
> same API (`ORCHESTRATOR_API_URL` + `ORCHESTRATOR_API_KEY`, or `--api-url`/`--api-key`).

For raw test output and per-activity detail, the **Temporal UI** (or the worker
logs) is the source of truth.

## Step 8 — Smarter codegen: it adapts to each repo

Out of the box, Spine **profiles each project and assembles the right
capabilities** instead of treating every repo the same — and can run codegen as
an **agentic loop** that uses tools mid-task.

**8.1 — See the plan (read-only, no LLM):**
```bash
orchestrator profile .                                  # what kind of project this is
orchestrator catalog list                               # every capability it can assemble
orchestrator catalog plan . --intent "Add CSV export"   # what it would use here
```
A plan is three things, each chosen by a rule from the profile: **skills** (match
the repo's conventions), **mcp_servers** (external tools to use — Step 9), and
**workflow_params** (run shape). In the pipeline (Step 7) the plan is shown **at
the intent gate**, so you approve the toolkit alongside the work.

**8.2 — Turn on the agentic loop:**
```bash
export SDLC_CODEGEN=llm            # real LLM codegen (not the built-in stub)
export SDLC_AGENTIC_CODEGEN=1      # run codegen as a think → act → observe loop
```
Instead of one shot, the agent reads files, queries the repo's knowledge graph,
writes, runs the tests, and fixes — and (Step 9) calls approved external tools.

- **Off by default** — single-shot stays default until you're happy with cost
  (the loop makes several model calls per feature).
- **Needs a tool-calling model** (`gpt-4o`, `claude-*`); otherwise it falls back
  to single-shot.
- **Safe by construction** — a hard step cap, a per-run spend budget
  (`SDLC_RUN_BUDGET_USD`), the same write guards as single-shot, and external
  tools allow-listed + write-gated. Destructive tool calls can **pause for your
  approval** mid-run, then resume with your decision.

You extend the catalog with new skills/tools/run-shapes via a selector
(language × task-type × has-DB); the planner picks them up automatically.

---

## Step 9 — Connect external tools (MCP)

Spine can use external **[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
servers** — read Confluence/Jira through Atlassian's MCP server, introspect a
database, and more — reusing the same `mcpServers` config you already use with
Claude or Codex.

**9.1 — Install + point at a config:**
```bash
pip install 'synaptixs-spine[mcp]'        # or from source: uv sync --extra mcp
```
Supply an `mcpServers` JSON file via `--config`, `$ORCHESTRATOR_MCP_CONFIG`, or
`./mcp.json`. Transport is inferred (`command` → stdio, `url` → HTTP). Example
`mcp.json` for Atlassian:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "confluence": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-atlassian"],
      "env": {
        "CONFLUENCE_URL": "https://your-org.atlassian.net/wiki",
        "CONFLUENCE_USERNAME": "you@org.com",
        "CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN": "<token>",
        "JIRA_URL": "https://your-org.atlassian.net",
        "JIRA_USERNAME": "you@org.com",
        "JIRA_API_TOKEN": "<token>"
      },
      "allow": ["confluence_get_page", "confluence_get_page_children", "jira_get_issue", "jira_search"]
    }
  }
}
```
- **`allow`** is an allow-list — only those tools are callable (omit = all, with a warning).
- **Writes are off by default**: mutating tools are refused unless you set
  `write_enabled: true` on that server.

**9.2 — Inspect + call:**
```bash
orchestrator mcp list                       # discovered tools (server:tool)
orchestrator mcp contracts                  # governance view: side-effects + write-gating
orchestrator mcp call confluence:confluence_get_page --args '{"page_id":"123"}'
```

**9.3 — Use them in a run:**
```bash
# Drive intake through Atlassian's MCP server instead of REST creds:
orchestrator sdlc feature --source mcp-confluence://<page_id> --safe
orchestrator sdlc feature --source mcp-jira://<issue-key> --safe   # Jira issue + its children
# Feed a database's real schema into codegen's grounding:
orchestrator mcp ingest-db --server <db-server-name>
```
`mcp-confluence` and `mcp-jira` are presets (one `mcp-atlassian` server usually serves both —
point them at it with `MCP_CONFLUENCE_SERVER` / `MCP_JIRA_SERVER`). For **any other** MCP
server, use the generic `mcp://<root>` and name its tools via `MCP_SOURCE_SERVER` /
`MCP_SOURCE_DOC_TOOL` / `MCP_SOURCE_CHILDREN_TOOL` (results are parsed leniently, falling back
to raw text). This routes source access through a governed MCP server instead of spreading
`CONFLUENCE_*` / `JIRA_*` tokens into the env.
In the pipeline (Step 7), configured MCP tools are auto-onboarded at startup with
the same rate-limit + audit + approval path.

**9.4 — Manage MCP servers from the web UI.** The **Connections** page
(`/app/connections`) lists every configured server and **tests each live**
(reachable? which allow-listed tools?), alongside your source/tracker status. Use
**Browse…** to pick an `mcp.json` anywhere on the machine (a server-side file
picker — the config lives on the server, so a normal upload can't select it). To
add / edit / remove servers from the page (it writes `mcp.json`), start with
`ORCHESTRATOR_MCP_CONFIG_WRITABLE=1` — off by default because a stdio server's
`command` runs on this machine. When it's off, the page shows the config path so
you can edit the file directly.

---

## Step 10 — Call it from Claude, Codex, or your IDE (MCP server)

The reverse of Step 9: Spine can **become** an MCP server, so any host
— Claude Code, the Codex app, Claude Desktop, claude.ai — can call your
"intent → reviewed PR" pipeline as tools, with the **same human gates**.

```bash
pip install 'synaptixs-spine[mcp]'        # or from source: uv sync --extra mcp
```

**10.1 — Local (the host launches it over stdio):**
```bash
orchestrator-mcp            # serves over stdio, reads ./.env for creds
```
Register with **Claude Code** via `.mcp.json`:
```json
{ "mcpServers": { "orchestrator": { "command": "orchestrator-mcp" } } }
```
Register with the **Codex app** in `~/.codex/config.toml` (a host launched from a
different cwd won't find `./.env`, so point `ORCHESTRATOR_DOTENV` at it — no secrets
are copied into the config):
```toml
[mcp_servers.spine]
command = "orchestrator-mcp"      # or an absolute path to the venv's console script
args = []
tool_timeout_sec = 600            # sdlc_feature does codegen + a build; give it room

[mcp_servers.spine.env]
ORCHESTRATOR_DOTENV = "/abs/path/to/your/.env"
```
Restart the host to pick up the server. The tools it exposes: `doctor`,
`ingest_preview`, `pkg_grounding`, `read_memory_bank`; the read-only **comprehension**
set — `map_repo`, `blast_radius`, `explain_symbol`, `investigate`, `localize`,
`regression_gaps`, `root_cause`, and **`docs_for`** (which docs describe a symbol, or a
repo-wide doc-coverage summary); and `sdlc_feature` — which takes `repo`, `language`,
`layout` (`new` = greenfield, `existing` = brownfield), and `package_name`, so you can
deliver into a fresh **or** an existing repo from the host.
(`sdlc_start_run`/`…_status`/`…_decide_gate`/`…_result` drive the long gated run.)

**As a first-class Codex plugin** (an entry in the plugin list, not just an
`mcp_servers` line): this repo ships a one-plugin marketplace under
[`codex-marketplace/`](codex-marketplace/). The MCP-server config above and the plugin
are two layers of the same thing — the plugin *bundles* that server plus branding.
```bash
pip install 'synaptixs-spine[mcp]'            # puts `orchestrator-mcp` on PATH
codex plugin marketplace add synaptixs/spine  # or a local path to codex-marketplace/
codex plugin add spine@spine
```
Then **Spine** shows up under `codex plugin list`. See
[codex-marketplace/README.md](codex-marketplace/README.md) for the manifest layout and
how creds (`ORCHESTRATOR_DOTENV`) are supplied.

**10.2 — Remote (hosted clients connect to a URL):**
```bash
orchestrator-mcp --http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080     # behind TLS in production
```
Pick one auth mode (a public bind without either is refused):
- **Shared secret** — set `ORCHESTRATOR_MCP_TOKEN` + `ORCHESTRATOR_MCP_RESOURCE_URL`; the client sends that token as its bearer.
- **OAuth introspection** — set `ORCHESTRATOR_MCP_ISSUER_URL`, `…_INTROSPECTION_URL`, client id/secret, and `…_REQUIRED_SCOPES` to validate every token against your IdP.

Destructive tools stay gated regardless of auth: `sdlc_feature(live=true)` and
`sdlc_start_run(create_jira=true)` both need an explicit `confirm=true`.

---

## Step 11 — Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `doctor` shows everything missing | Run it from the folder that has your `.env`. |
| Codegen times out | Set `ORCHESTRATOR_INTAKE_MODEL=gpt-4o` (or another fast model). |
| Private repo clone fails | Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` (PAT) or the GitHub App (`GITHUB_APP_*`). |
| Console asks for an API key | Paste the `ORCHESTRATOR_API_KEY` you started the server with (`dev-key` above). |
| `sdlc run` hangs at a gate | Approve it in the console or via `/v1/approvals/.../approve`. |
| Worker does nothing | It reads the process env, not `.env` — `set -a; source .env; set +a` before starting it. |
| `mcp list` shows no servers | Add an `mcpServers` file (`--config`, `$ORCHESTRATOR_MCP_CONFIG`, or `./mcp.json`). |
| `mcp` commands fail to import | Install the extra: `pip install 'synaptixs-spine[mcp]'` (or `uv sync --extra mcp`). |
| An MCP tool is "not allow-listed" / write-gated | Add it to the server's `allow`; for mutating tools set `write_enabled: true`. |
| Agentic loop falls back to single-shot | Use a tool-calling model (`gpt-4o`, `claude-*`) and set `SDLC_CODEGEN=llm`. |
| `orchestrator-mcp --http` refuses to start | Set `ORCHESTRATOR_MCP_TOKEN` or `…_INTROSPECTION_URL`, bind `127.0.0.1`, or pass `--allow-unauthenticated` on a trusted net. |
| Remote client gets 401 | Send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; for introspection confirm the token is active and carries the required scope. |
| `Nondeterminism error` on replay | An in-flight workflow predates a code change. Terminate the stale run (Temporal UI); new runs are unaffected. |
