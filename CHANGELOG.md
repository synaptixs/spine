# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); the package is `synaptixs-spine`
(import/CLI stay `orchestrator`).

## 3.6.0 — Knowledge-graph-grounded design & RCA

A suite of new, deterministic-first CLI commands that ground engineering work — design,
debugging, and root-cause analysis — in the Product Knowledge Graph, plus the call-graph
extraction that makes them work across languages. Every command is inspectable and states
its own limits rather than implying certainty.

### Added

- **`orchestrator design`** — spec × knowledge graph → a grounded design with a **blast
  radius** (which modules a change touches, who imports them, the call hotspots) and an
  **unverified-references** flag for named paths absent from the graph. Deterministic by
  default; `--llm` writes the prose.
- **`orchestrator investigate`** — research a ticket against the codebase before designing:
  where it lands in the code (real symbols with `file:line` + caller counts) and the relevant
  committed `episteme/` knowledge. Ticket from a source URI or inline.
- **`orchestrator localize`** — parse a stack trace / pytest failure and resolve each frame to
  the repo symbol it names, pointing at the likely fault site and its callers.
- **`orchestrator rca`** — a gated root-cause report: fault site, ranked root-cause
  *hypotheses* with evidence (exception priors, recent git churn, call sites), the regression
  surface a fix must cover, and a scoped fix approach. Stops at analysis — no autonomous code.
- **`orchestrator regression`** — blast-radius regression coverage: split the call-graph
  impact of a change into tests that already exercise it vs production code with no covering
  test (the gaps).
- **Jira as a read source** (`jira://PROJ-123` / `jira://PROJ` / `jira://jql/…`) — ingest
  existing issues as requirements, the read counterpart to the Jira issue-tracker sink.
- **Generalized MCP-backed sources** — `mcp-jira` and `mcp-confluence` presets plus a generic
  `mcp` escape hatch, so any onboarded MCP server can back intake (route access through a
  governed server instead of spreading REST tokens).

### Changed

- **Call graphs across the stack:** the Java and TypeScript front-ends now extract `CALLS`
  edges (precision-first; TypeScript resolves relative imports to the definition, so
  cross-file call graphs connect). Impact, RCA, and regression coverage now work on Python,
  C, C++, C#, Java, and TypeScript.
- **`FactStore.impact_across`** — composed transitive blast radius over CALLS + IMPORTS +
  REFERENCES, so impact traces across the code, module, and data layers.
- The README banner now shows the platform's full capability map rather than a single pipeline.

## 3.5.0 — Security hardening

This release is the output of a security baseline of Spine's own source tree. Nothing
here is a claim that the codebase is "secure" — it is a description, verifiable against
this repository, of the checks we now run and the issues we found and fixed.

### 🔒 Security

- **Continuous checks in CI, on every pull request:**
  - **CodeQL** dataflow analysis for Python and JavaScript.
  - **`pip-audit`** over the resolved lockfile (not the ambient environment — bare
    `pip-audit` in a uv checkout audits the wrong thing and false-passes).
  - **`bandit`-class static analysis** via ruff's flake8-bandit (`S`) rules, wired
    into the existing lint gate.
  - **Dependabot** for weekly dependency and GitHub-Actions updates.
- **A multi-model adversarial self-review** across the full source tree: 863 candidate
  findings were triaged by one model, then independently verified by a stronger model
  instructed to *refute* each one. 174 of the high-severity candidates were refuted as
  safe-by-design; **7 confirmed issues were fixed, each with a regression test.**
- **All patchable dependency CVEs resolved** — 17 of 18 known advisories fixed by
  version bumps (aiohttp, starlette, cryptography, langsmith, langgraph, pydantic-
  settings). The one remaining (`click`'s `click.edit()` command injection) is
  unreachable — Spine never calls that function — and is documented rather than
  force-fixed, because the fix would regress the `semgrep` scanner by ~2 years.
- Coordinated disclosure via [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

### Fixed

Security fixes from the review above, described at the level of *what class of issue*
rather than a reproduction:

- **Path traversal** in the knowledge-base reader and the `memory-bank` capability
  endpoint — an untrusted section name or a symlink committed in a cloned repo could
  read files outside the intended directory. Reads are now confined to the bank dir.
- **Stored XSS** in the operator web UI — the shared HTML escaper escaped `&<>` but not
  quotes, so an untrusted value (e.g. a cloned-repo file name) placed in a quoted HTML
  attribute could break out. The escaper now escapes quotes across all web UI files.
- **SSRF backstop** for remote-repo cloning — the internal-host guard missed obfuscated
  IPv4 encodings (integer, hex, octal, short-form) that resolve to loopback. These are
  now normalized and blocked. (The guard was already robust under its default
  restrictive host allow-list; this hardens the opt-in `*` mode.)
- **Prompt-injection hardening** in the codegen/design/review pipeline — untrusted
  cloned-repo content fed into LLM prompts is now fenced and marked as data, and the
  review judge is instructed to ignore injected verdicts. This is defense-in-depth; the
  human merge approval remains the authoritative gate.

### Added

- `SECURITY.md` disclosure policy surfaced in the README.
- Security review plan and methodology in `docs/specs/security-review-plan.md`.
