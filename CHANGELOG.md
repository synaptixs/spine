# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); the package is `synaptixs-spine`
(import/CLI stay `orchestrator`).

## 3.8.3 — Architecture diagram

Adds a full **architecture diagram** and an [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) that walks the whole
platform end to end — the six layers, every component, the two human gates, and the Product
Knowledge Graph they all read from. Documentation only; no code or behaviour change.

### Added

- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** — how Spine fits together, layer by layer, with a diagram
  that renders on GitHub and in Spine's own web UI.
- A **static architecture image** (`assets/spine-architecture.png`), shown in the README.

## 3.8.2 — Doc ingestion reaches HTML and Office

3.8.1 folded Markdown, reST, plain text and PDF into the graph. This release adds the
remaining **file** formats teams actually keep specs in — **HTML** and **Word/Excel** — so a
`.docx` architecture doc or an exported HTML spec sitting in your repo becomes `Doc` nodes
`MENTIONS`-linked to the code it describes, exactly like a README.

Still deterministic, still no LLM, still a no-op on a repo with no docs.

### Added

- **HTML ingestion** (`.html`/`.htm`) — no extra needed. `<h1>`…`<h6>` become section
  boundaries (so an HTML doc sections exactly like markdown), and inline `<code>` is
  preserved as a code claim, so the symbols a doc names actually bind. `<script>`/`<style>`
  bodies are ignored; malformed markup is skipped rather than fatal.
- **Word & Excel ingestion** behind a new **`[office]`** extra
  (`pip install 'synaptixs-spine[office]'`). `.docx` maps Word's heading styles to sections
  and treats monospace runs as code claims — the Word equivalent of backticks — and keeps
  table text, which is where spec documents put API and field lists. `.xlsx` gives one
  section per sheet and keeps string cells only (numbers and formula results are data, not
  prose about code). Encrypted or corrupt documents are skipped.
- **Markdown front matter** is now read as prose: the *values* of a `---` block (`title:`,
  `module:`, `tags:`) bind like the text they stand for, while the keys and fences no longer
  leak into the graph as noise.

### Changed

- Documentation formats are now **registered readers** rather than hard-coded branches, so
  adding a format touches no existing one. Behaviour for existing formats is unchanged.
- Standalone `.yaml`/`.yml` files are **deliberately not ingested**. A repo's YAML is
  overwhelmingly configuration, and treating it as documentation would inflate the doc
  coverage `state` reports and flood doc-drift with config values that were never prose.
  YAML's documentary case — front matter — is covered above.

## 3.8.1 — Doc & PDF ingestion: your docs become code-linked facts

Spine now reads a repository's **documentation** — Markdown, reStructuredText, plain text,
and **PDF** — into the Product Knowledge Graph as first-class **`Doc` nodes**, each
**`MENTIONS`**-linked to the code symbol it describes. So comprehension can answer *"which
docs describe `X`?"*, *"how documented is this?"*, and *"do the docs still match the code?"* —
all deterministic, no LLM. This is the *knowledge-doc* half of Spine's doc story; the
*structured-doc* half (OpenSpec `openspec://` → intents) already shipped. It closes the
biggest remaining reach gap vs. doc-graph tools.

Nothing to configure: docs are folded in automatically when you run `orchestrator understand`
or `orchestrator state`. A repo with no docs behaves exactly as before.

### Added

- **Doc ingestion** — `understand`/`state` now emit `Doc` nodes + `MENTIONS` edges. Binding is
  **precision-first**: a mention becomes an edge only when it resolves to exactly one symbol.
  Reuses the deterministic doc→symbol binder already in `pkg/docs.py`.
- **PDF support** behind a new **`[docs]`** extra (`pip install 'synaptixs-spine[docs]'`, lazy
  `pypdf`). The base install stays stdlib-only; malformed or scanned (image-only) PDFs are
  skipped, never fatal — no OCR.
- **`state` Documentation section** — doc count, **symbol coverage %** (how much of the code the
  docs describe), and top **doc drift** (doc claims about code the graph can't resolve —
  renamed/removed symbols), filtered to real symbols so paths/URLs/filenames don't drown it.
- **`docs_for` `/spine` MCP tool** — with a `symbol`, the docs that describe it; with no symbol,
  a doc-coverage summary + top drift. Joins the read-only comprehension tool set; documented in
  the Claude/Codex guides and the `understand-codebase` skill.
- **Section-granular `Doc` nodes** — Markdown is split by heading into `doc:README.md#usage`
  nodes (bounded), so a `MENTIONS` edge points at the *section* that names a symbol, with
  provenance at the heading line.
- **Doc-grounded codegen** — `sdlc feature` grounding now folds a reused symbol's documenting
  prose into the codegen context, so generated code sees not just an API but what it's for.
- **Doc-drift review finding** — `GroundingVerifier.doc_findings` surfaces stale-doc symbol
  claims as an informational, source-anchored finding.

## 3.8.0 — The `/spine` comprehension skill

Spine's read-only comprehension is now a **drop-in skill** any assistant can call — Codex
(plugin) and Claude Code (an `understand-codebase` Agent Skill) — so you can ask about a
codebase in plain language and get engineering *decisions*, not just a map: what a change
breaks, what's untested, and where a ticket or bug lands, each grounded to `file:line`.

### Added

- **Comprehension MCP tools** on the Spine plugin server, all read-only, deterministic
  (no LLM), and needing no credentials: `map_repo` (structure, call-hotspots, coverage
  gaps, recommendations), `blast_radius` ("what breaks if I change X" — callers +
  cross-layer reach), `explain_symbol`, `investigate` (where a ticket lands), `localize`
  (stack trace → fault site), and `regression_gaps` (blast-radius symbols with no covering
  test). Each returns structured fields **plus** a `markdown` rendering. They join
  `read_memory_bank` (a repo's committed `episteme/`).
- **`root_cause`** — a grounded root-cause report (fault site, ranked hypotheses with
  evidence, regression surface, fix approach). Deterministic by default; `use_llm=true`
  opts into LLM-enriched hypotheses.
- **`understand-codebase` Agent Skill** bundled with the Claude Code plugin — tells Claude
  which tool to reach for, so you just ask in plain language.
- **git-URL support** across the comprehension tools — point them at a local path *or* a
  git URL (shallow-cloned behind the same host allow-list as the CLI). Serve them to a
  remote host over HTTP with `orchestrator-mcp --http`.

## 3.7.0 — Go: the 8th PKG language

Go is now a first-class language across the whole stack — comprehension, the call and
interface graph, and greenfield **and** brownfield codegen — so `understand`, `state`,
`design`, `investigate`, `localize`, `rca`, `regression`, grounding, and
`sdlc feature --language go` all work on Go repos. Install with the `go` extra
(`pip install 'synaptixs-spine[go]'`); codegen needs the `go` toolchain on PATH.

### Added

- **Go comprehension** (`go` extra, tree-sitter-go) — `Module`/`Type`/`Function`/`Field` +
  `IMPORTS`/`CONTAINS`. Go's module unit is the **package = its directory**, so every `.go`
  file in a dir merges into one component (the first front-end where that holds).
- **Go call + data + interface graph** — `CALLS` (same-file package functions and
  receiver-method calls), `REFERENCES` (same-package struct-field types), and the Go
  highlight, **`IMPLEMENTS` by method-set matching**: because Go has no `implements` keyword,
  a concrete type is linked to each in-repo interface it structurally satisfies (matched by
  method name + arity over value **and** pointer receivers). So blast-radius, `design`,
  `rca`, and `regression` light up on Go.
- **Go codegen** (`sdlc feature --language go`) — scaffolds/extends a module and builds +
  tests it with `go build ./...` / `go test ./...`, with co-located `_test.go` tests. It is
  **multi-module aware**: the runner builds and tests the module(s) a change actually
  touches (not just the repo root), so code generated into a sub-module is never a false
  green.

### Changed

- **`sdlc feature --language` is now validated** against the supported set — an unknown value
  errors instead of silently scaffolding a Python project.

## 3.6.1 — Shareable codebase-intelligence report

`orchestrator state . --out report.html` now emits a single **self-contained HTML file** you
open in a browser and forward to your team — the engineering-decision counterpart to a
concept-map `graph.html`. Deterministic, no LLM, nothing fetched. It packages the analysis
`state` already computes, so this is rendering, not new comprehension.

### Added

- **Shareable HTML report** — `orchestrator state . --out report.html` writes one
  self-contained, theme-aware (light/dark) file with a provenance header, plain-language
  overview, architecture diagram, blast-radius hotspots, risk & health, test-coverage gaps,
  security surface, recent activity, and prioritized recommendations. `--out *.html` selects
  HTML; any other extension keeps today's markdown. `--no-timestamp` gives byte-stable output
  for CI diffs. The `--lens stakeholder` view drops the jargon-heavy sections.
- **Deterministic architecture diagram** — an inline SVG (components grouped into zones,
  weighted dependency arrows) laid out seeded-in-Python, so the same commit renders the same
  picture; it grid-wraps large zones to stay legible and themes with the page (no mermaid, no
  external assets).
- **Graph-quantified blast radius** — the spotlight quantifies the cross-layer impact of the
  top hotspot via `impact_across` ("changing X → N dependents across M files") and lists
  blast-radius symbols with no covering test via the regression plan (`build_regression_plan`).
- **In-browser filter** — a client-side search box hides non-matching rows, dims non-matching
  architecture components, and collapses emptied sections; vanilla JS, no build step, still one
  self-contained file.

## 3.6.0 — Knowledge-graph-grounded design & RCA

A suite of new, deterministic-first CLI commands that ground engineering work — design,
debugging, and root-cause analysis — in the Product Knowledge Graph, plus the call-graph
extraction that makes them work across languages. Every command is inspectable and states
its own limits rather than implying certainty.

### Added

- **`orchestrator design`** — spec × knowledge graph → a grounded design with a **blast
  radius** (which modules a change touches, who imports them, the call hotspots) and an
  **unverified-references** flag for named paths absent from the graph. Deterministic by
  default; `--llm` writes the prose.
- **`orchestrator investigate`** — research a ticket against the codebase before designing:
  where it lands in the code (real symbols with `file:line` + caller counts) and the relevant
  committed `episteme/` knowledge. Ticket from a source URI or inline.
- **`orchestrator localize`** — parse a stack trace / pytest failure and resolve each frame to
  the repo symbol it names, pointing at the likely fault site and its callers.
- **`orchestrator rca`** — a gated root-cause report: fault site, ranked root-cause
  *hypotheses* with evidence (exception priors, recent git churn, call sites), the regression
  surface a fix must cover, and a scoped fix approach. Stops at analysis — no autonomous code.
- **`orchestrator regression`** — blast-radius regression coverage: split the call-graph
  impact of a change into tests that already exercise it vs production code with no covering
  test (the gaps).
- **Jira as a read source** (`jira://PROJ-123` / `jira://PROJ` / `jira://jql/…`) — ingest
  existing issues as requirements, the read counterpart to the Jira issue-tracker sink.
- **Generalized MCP-backed sources** — `mcp-jira` and `mcp-confluence` presets plus a generic
  `mcp` escape hatch, so any onboarded MCP server can back intake (route access through a
  governed server instead of spreading REST tokens).

### Changed

- **Call graphs across the stack:** the Java and TypeScript front-ends now extract `CALLS`
  edges (precision-first; TypeScript resolves relative imports to the definition, so
  cross-file call graphs connect). Impact, RCA, and regression coverage now work on Python,
  C, C++, C#, Java, and TypeScript.
- **`FactStore.impact_across`** — composed transitive blast radius over CALLS + IMPORTS +
  REFERENCES, so impact traces across the code, module, and data layers.
- The README banner now shows the platform's full capability map rather than a single pipeline.

## 3.5.0 — Security hardening

This release is the output of a security baseline of Spine's own source tree. Nothing
here is a claim that the codebase is "secure" — it is a description, verifiable against
this repository, of the checks we now run and the issues we found and fixed.

### 🔒 Security

- **Continuous checks in CI, on every pull request:**
  - **CodeQL** dataflow analysis for Python and JavaScript.
  - **`pip-audit`** over the resolved lockfile (not the ambient environment — bare
    `pip-audit` in a uv checkout audits the wrong thing and false-passes).
  - **`bandit`-class static analysis** via ruff's flake8-bandit (`S`) rules, wired
    into the existing lint gate.
  - **Dependabot** for weekly dependency and GitHub-Actions updates.
- **A multi-model adversarial self-review** across the full source tree: 863 candidate
  findings were triaged by one model, then independently verified by a stronger model
  instructed to *refute* each one. 174 of the high-severity candidates were refuted as
  safe-by-design; **7 confirmed issues were fixed, each with a regression test.**
- **All patchable dependency CVEs resolved** — 17 of 18 known advisories fixed by
  version bumps (aiohttp, starlette, cryptography, langsmith, langgraph, pydantic-
  settings). The one remaining (`click`'s `click.edit()` command injection) is
  unreachable — Spine never calls that function — and is documented rather than
  force-fixed, because the fix would regress the `semgrep` scanner by ~2 years.
- Coordinated disclosure via [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

### Fixed

Security fixes from the review above, described at the level of *what class of issue*
rather than a reproduction:

- **Path traversal** in the knowledge-base reader and the `memory-bank` capability
  endpoint — an untrusted section name or a symlink committed in a cloned repo could
  read files outside the intended directory. Reads are now confined to the bank dir.
- **Stored XSS** in the operator web UI — the shared HTML escaper escaped `&<>` but not
  quotes, so an untrusted value (e.g. a cloned-repo file name) placed in a quoted HTML
  attribute could break out. The escaper now escapes quotes across all web UI files.
- **SSRF backstop** for remote-repo cloning — the internal-host guard missed obfuscated
  IPv4 encodings (integer, hex, octal, short-form) that resolve to loopback. These are
  now normalized and blocked. (The guard was already robust under its default
  restrictive host allow-list; this hardens the opt-in `*` mode.)
- **Prompt-injection hardening** in the codegen/design/review pipeline — untrusted
  cloned-repo content fed into LLM prompts is now fenced and marked as data, and the
  review judge is instructed to ignore injected verdicts. This is defense-in-depth; the
  human merge approval remains the authoritative gate.

### Added

- `SECURITY.md` disclosure policy surfaced in the README.
- Security review plan and methodology in `docs/specs/security-review-plan.md`.
